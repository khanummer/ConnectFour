This game was made completely by using HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT. 

If you are having trouble understanding how to play, just click the 'HOW TO PLAY' button near the bottom of the page.

In the future I plan on implementing velocity to animate my game board and game pieces, add sound effects / music, and have the game playable on all mobile devices.
